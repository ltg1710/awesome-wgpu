## About Rendy

About Rendy and wgpu https://community.amethyst.rs/t/skepticism-about-rendy/1221/9

>wgpu uses gfx-hal and parts of rendy, totally fine on DX12 on Windows https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/eh7wkx/the_state_of_ggez_2020/fcj1746/

>We hoped Amethyst team would help, but that didn't happen either. https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/eh7wkx/the_state_of_ggez_2020/fcipapq/

>Switching to rendy nearly killed this project due to the time and effort required https://community.amethyst.rs/t/skepticism-about-rendy/1221/11

>This duality of APIs in gfx-hal worked to an extent. Providing safety was impossible without imposing some restrictions or overhead. In the command pool example, it’s only safe to re-use a command buffer if it’s done execution on the GPU, and the user doesn’t intent to use it. We can’t possibly know this in gfx-hal without introducing overhead… So, at the end of the day, we decided that the “typed” (user-facing) layer is still useful, it doesn’t have to be a part of gfx-hal. Thus, we removed it, recommending rendy-command as a replacement. This slimmed up gfx-hal API surface and allowed us to straighten up the terminology (no more “RawXXX” or “XxxTyped”). https://gfx-rs.github.io/2019/10/01/update.html
